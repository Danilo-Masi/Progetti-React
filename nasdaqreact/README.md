# NasdaqReact

NasdaqReact is an application designed to facilitate user monitoring of their preferred currencies. It utilizes the free plan of CoinrankingAPI (https://developers.coinranking.com/api) to obtain real-time currency data. CoinrankingAPI only provides cryptocurrency values; I was unable to find a free API that met my needs for stock market values.

## Features

- Search for a cryptocurrency using either the name (e.g., Bitcoin) or the code (BTC) as parameters.
- Save a specific cryptocurrency of interest to your favorites.
- Remove a cryptocurrency from your favorites.
- View a graph depicting the price trend over time of the cryptocurrency you have set as a favorite.
